Detectors
=========

Detectors do the heavy lifting in terms of the activity identification process. Each detector is dedicated to detecting
a single type of activity. For instance, DrillingConnectionsDetector instance will only be concerned with connections made
while drilling, not tripping. Each Detector is intended to perform a pre-check and a post-check on the incoming data and
the outgoing data, respectively. The pre-check is meant to restrict the detection attempt to data where success is probably
likely. The post-check is a form of sanity check to verify that nothing unphysical is being asserted as truth. For example,
if the hole depth changes by 500' and only a single connection event is found. This is an impossible scenario given that
stand lengths are typically only about 90'.

Detector Base

This is parent class that all detectors should inherit from. It is not meant to be directly instantiated.
