Clients
==========

Clients are responsible for all things related to the interaction with the database. In our case, we primarily work with
OSIsoft PI database. One way to interact with an OSIsoft PI database is through their provided web API. If interaction
with other types of databases is desired, one must create another client that is suited to that database. It is best practice
to implement the interface defined by the AbstractClient in a concrete class, such as the PiWebApiClient does. This will ensure
that the new client can be used by other modules in this package, if needed.


Client
----------
This is an abstract base class that defines the interface for a client. All subclasses of client must implement this interface.

.. autoclass:: radical.dataIO.clients.AbstractClient
    :members:

PiWebApiClient
--------------
This is a concrete class of the Client abstract base class.

.. autoclass:: radical.dataIO.clients.PiWebApiClient
    :members:
    :show-inheritance:
